# sdcli

A sdbase command line tool for automating important grunt work.

## Use

Run `python -m pip install git+https://github.com/sdbase/sdcli.git` to install.

This is a private Python package, so you cannot install it via PyPI. You will need to be logged into GitHub on your machine.

You can view command help with `sdcli --help`.
